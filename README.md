# StudentLogbook_API
I made a semi-fullstack project (just missing the frontend lol) called StudentLogbook which uses a RESTful API to allow an admin to edit student, course, and enrollment info. Created a REST API using FASTAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemey for the Relationional tables, and schemas needed.
